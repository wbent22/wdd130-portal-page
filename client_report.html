        <h2>Client Project Report</h2>
        <p class="report-text">
            As a Client, I decided on what to include with my sister. I knew that I wanted a gallery and an about page, so I ask her for pictures.
            I just emailed my developer, there was no issue with communication, I mostly just let him do what he thought was best.
            I think the home page looked really nice, the other pages seemed unfinished though.
            Next time I hire a team, I will make sure that the team has worked together before.

        <p class="report-text">
            As a Lead Developer, from the first day, I let my juniors know which site they were to work on and sent them the site plan.
            From there I mostly emailed them to communicate. I did have one junior that responded when I first sent gave them assignments, but then I never heard from him
            and he never worked on his assigned page either.
            I communicated with my client using email, I never saw any issues.
            Github was very easy to use to publish the page, cause all I had to do was email the url to my client.
            I thought github was very useful, and I can see how useful it would be on much larger scale projects, but I enjoyed using it.
        </p>
        <p class="report-text">
            As a junior developer, there was little communication from both of my leads, but that was all that was necessary. I got the site plan for my asssigned page
            and created the page accordingly, while also referring to the hoem page the lead had created.
            I didn't run into any issues with github, it all went smoothly.
        </p>
        <p class="report-text">
            Overall, the most challenging part was probably the small things, there were many things or questions I had that were really too small to send an email about,
            so I just had to make up something. That is mostly just me overthinking, but it does make it challenging when the site plan is not very specific.
            I enjoyed being able to work on multiple projects at the same time, it made it fun to see how other people code, and being a junior I was able to try to 
            seemlessly match the home page without it looking like it was done by someone else.
            If I did the project again, I don't think I would change much. I might try harder to communicate with my junior developers, as well as get feedback from the client.
